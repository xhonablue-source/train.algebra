# 🚆 MathCraft: Jet Train Motion

**Author:** Xavier Honablue, M.Ed  
**Tagline:** _A dynamic motion simulation and algebraic reasoning app to visualize speed, distance, and time._

## 🎯 Overview

**MathCraft: Jet Train Motion** is an interactive educational tool built in React to help students explore the concept of **relative speed** through animated train motion scenarios. Whether the trains move in the same direction or toward each other, this app breaks down the math visually and conceptually—making abstract motion problems engaging and accessible.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔁 **Same vs. Opposite Direction Scenarios**
  - Subtract or add train speeds to model catch-up or collision dynamics.
- 🎥 **Live Animation**
  - Watch two trains race or collide in real-time based on your speed and head-start input.
- 🧮 **Built-In Math Explanation**
  - Clear algebraic breakdowns reinforce core concepts like `Distance = Speed × Time`.
- 🎨 **Responsive, Engaging Design**
  - Mobile-friendly with visual elements like emoji trains, pulse markers, and color-coded logic.
- 🧩 **Built for Exploration**
  - Adjustable train speeds and head-start settings promote curiosity and hypothesis testing.
